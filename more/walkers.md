## Lifts to and from the coast path

We can arrange pick ups and drop offs from nearby sections of the South West Coast Path, from **Hartland Quay to Clovelly**.

The Anchor is a **Way Maker**, supporting the South West Coast Path.

---

## Packed lunches

We can supply packed lunches, with **vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options** available.

---

## How much notice?

- We need a **minimum of 24 hours notice** for pick ups.  
- Packed lunches should be ordered **the night before**.  
- Please let us know if you have any particular dietary requirements.

---

## “I got absolutely soaked!”

No problem.

We can dry your clothes at The Anchor whilst you wait in our comfortable, warm, friendly bar, with a nice cup of **Assam**, freshly brewed coffee, or something a little stronger. We even have cake.

## The South West Coast Path

England’s longest waymarked long-distance footpath: **630 miles** in total.

If you walk the entire distance, you’ll have climbed **114,931 feet**, equivalent to climbing **Chomolangma nearly four times**.
