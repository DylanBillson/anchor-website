## Our Story

The Anchor Inn sits on Fore Street in the centre of Hartland, a village shaped by the coast, countryside, and community around it.

We are proud to be a traditional village pub — somewhere you can enjoy a proper meal, a good drink, live music, and the kind of atmosphere that feels relaxed and unpretentious.

Whether you’re here after a long walk along the South West Coast Path, meeting friends for Sunday Roast, or staying the night in one of our rooms, we aim to make you feel at home.

## Our Philosophy

We believe in:

- Quality ingredients, cooked well  
- A warm and welcoming environment  
- Supporting the local community  
- Creating a space where visitors and locals mix naturally  

The Anchor is not about being flashy — it’s about being reliable, friendly, and genuinely enjoyable to spend time in.

## Food, Drink & Community

Our kitchen serves lunch and evening menus through the week, with Sunday Roasts at the weekend.

Behind the bar you’ll find a carefully selected range of drinks, alongside darts, pool, and a sun terrace for warmer days.

We regularly host live music and events — see our **What’s On** page for upcoming dates.
