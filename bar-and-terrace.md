## The bar

<div class="two-col two-col--top">
  <div>
    <p>The Anchor’s bar is a place to settle in — whether you’re calling in for a quick pint, meeting friends for an evening, or warming up after a walk.</p>
    <p>We aim to keep things simple: a friendly atmosphere, a well-kept selection behind the bar, and a space that feels welcoming to locals and visitors alike.</p>

    <p>On warmer days, our terrace is the perfect spot for a drink — especially in the afternoon and early evening.</p>
    <p>It’s a relaxed outdoor space where you can unwind, catch up, and enjoy the village atmosphere.</p>

## The two pianos

<div class="two-col two-col--top">
  <div>
    <p>Yes, two.</p>
    <p>They’re part of what makes the Anchor feel like the Anchor: a pub with personality, where music and community naturally show up.</p>
    <p>If you play, you’re welcome to use them, just be considerate of the room and the time of day.</p>
