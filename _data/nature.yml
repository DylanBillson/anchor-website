  - title: "Windbury Head Fort"
    image: "/assets/img/local/nature/windbury-head-fort.avif"
    description: "Crowning the summit of Beckland cliffs at 330 feet above sea level is Windbury Head Camp, thought to be an Iron Age enclosure or hill fort. Its precarious position jutting out into the Bristol Channel with its longer axis forming the edge of the cliff suggests that part of the original site has been eroded by the sea. The National Trust aims to keep the earthwork clearly visible so that visitors can appreciate the structure and setting of the site. Paths lead to the Fort from the South West Coast Path and from the National Trust carpark at Brownsham Woods."
