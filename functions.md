## Hosting at The Anchor

The Anchor Inn is a relaxed, friendly place for gatherings — whether you’re organising a birthday meal, a wake, a post-walk group stop, or a small community event.

We can help you plan something simple and enjoyable, with food and drinks options that fit the occasion.

## What we can offer

- A warm, welcoming village pub setting  
- Flexible food options (from casual to more structured)  
- Drinks packages and bar tabs (if helpful)  
- Space for groups (subject to availability)  
- A straightforward, friendly booking process  

If you’re not sure what you need yet, that’s fine — just tell us the basics (date, approximate numbers, and the type of event) and we’ll take it from there.

## Food & drink options

We’re happy to talk through what’s possible depending on the day, time, and group size.

If you already know the style you’re after (e.g. a sit-down meal, buffet-style, lighter bites), include that in your message.
